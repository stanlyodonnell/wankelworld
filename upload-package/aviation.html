                            <h2>Why Rotary Engines for Aircraft?</h2>
                            <p>The Wankel rotary engine has several characteristics that make it particularly well-suited for aviation applications:</p>
                            
                            <h3>Power-to-Weight Ratio</h3>
                            <p>Aviation is obsessed with weight. Every kilogram matters. The rotary produces similar power to a piston engine of twice the displacement while weighing significantly less. This means more payload or fuel capacity for the same engine weight.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Smooth Operation</h3>
                            <p>The rotary's spinning motion produces minimal vibration. This reduces airframe fatigue, improves pilot comfort, and means avionics last longer without the constant shaking of a reciprocating engine.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Compact Size</h3>
                            <p>The rotary's small physical dimensions allow for more aerodynamic cowling designs. A 13B rotary can fit where larger piston engines cannot, opening up design possibilities for aircraft manufacturers.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Reliability</h3>
                            <p>With only three moving parts in a twin-rotor engine, there are fewer components to fail. No valves, valve springs, camshafts, or timing chains means less maintenance and fewer failure points.</p>

                            <h2>Curtiss-Wright: The Aviation Pioneer</h2>
                            <p>Curtiss-Wright was one of the first companies to license the Wankel engine for aviation. In the 1960s and 70s, they developed several rotary engines for aircraft use, including the RC2-60.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The RC2-60</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Twin-rotor</li>
                                <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> 1.2L</li>
                                <li><strong>Power:</strong> 185 hp</li>
                                <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 182 lbs (dry)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The RC2-60 was used experimentally in various light aircraft and demonstrated the rotary's potential for aviation. Its power-to-weight ratio exceeded comparable piston engines of the era.</p>

                            <h2>Cicaré Helicopters</h2>
                            <p>Argentinian helicopter manufacturer Cicaré has used Wankel rotary engines in their light helicopters. The smooth power delivery and light weight of the rotary make it ideal for the demanding requirements of rotary-wing flight.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Notable Models</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cicaré CH-14:</strong> Experimental helicopter using a Mazda 13B engine</li>
                                <li><strong>Cicaré CK.1:</strong> Ultralight helicopter with rotary power</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The absence of vibration from the rotary engine is particularly valuable in helicopters, where vibration is a constant challenge for airframe and pilot fatigue.</p>
