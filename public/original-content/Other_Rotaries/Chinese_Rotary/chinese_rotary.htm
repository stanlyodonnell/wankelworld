column has discussed rotary development in Russia. It shouldn't be surprising,
then, that such work has also taken place in the People's Republic of China,
particularly at the South China Institute of Technology at Guangzhou. But this
rotary program is even more mysterious than the Russians', and my primary source
for it is a US Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) paper, no. 880628 of 1988,
by Chen Teluan of the institute. The paper cites a few other sources, all
Chinese. My letters to Mr. Chen for an update and technical information have so
far gone unanswered. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

Wankel research began in China back in early 1960 (!); the paper reports a claim
that over 150 &quot;factories and research institutes&quot; were involved with
the engine in the '60s. Testing was rather extensive, including engines of 1 to
3 rotors, &quot;water and air cooled, compression- and spark-ignition, with a
displacement per rotor ranging from 150 to 1500 c.c.” In the early '70s
&quot;common technical key difficulties&quot; led most researchers to end their
work. Chen's institute and a few others concentrated on solving these and had
done so by the early '80s. The emphasis was mostly on vehicle use. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

Two water-cooled 2-rotor gasoline engines believed suitable for production by
the time of the SAE paper were the GZ2-900 with 900 cc per rotor, a 9.5:1
compression ratio, 120 hp at 3600 rpm and a weight of 454 lb; and the JZ211B
with 1094 cc per rotor, 8.5:1 compression ratio, 158 hp at 4000 rpm, and weight
573 lb. The rotor dimensions were not given, though curiously the overall engine
dimensions were: the GZ2-900, 23.9 in long the JZ211B, 36.2 in. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

These engines are clearly on the large side. Their state of technology can be
gauged by the use of alloy cast iron with (apparently) NO coating for the rotor
housings and, at first, steel apex seals! Newer apex seals are ceramic, and the
paper implies but does not explicitly say that the housing material is now
different. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

Manufacturing economy has obviously been emphasized as much as improving fuel
efficiency. Longetivity compared to, say, a Mazda rotary has been secondary.
Tests in trucks and buses in the mid-'80s showed that the JZ211B could typically
go for 60,000 km (37,000 mi) before overhaul, though one made over double that.
According to cost analyses based on fleet use in rugged Chinese conditions
compared with piston engines, the rotary was more economical because of its much
lower overhaul cost. Its fuel cost was quite comparable and in certain
applications even lower. By 1988 endurance tests of 1,000 hours were about to
begin. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

Tests of compound-induction and multi-fuel stratified-charge versions were also
occurring and showed much promise. Multifuel capability would include safer,
cheaper diesel fuel, and this rotary would have &quot;the advantage over a
reciprocating diesel engine in specific weight and specific volume, and over [a]
small gas turbine [!] In fuel consumption rate, air consumption and production
costs.” Aside from the trucks, buses, &quot;high-speed boats&quot;, small
hovercraft, and generator sets the conventional versions have been tested in,
multifuel versions &quot;will play an important role&quot; in
&quot;special-purpose vehicle[s] as well as military applications&quot;. Note
that comment. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

All this research is meant to benefit the Chinese military in the long run. It
probably explains the relative lack of specific engineering details in this
paper. If the US ever faces war with China, their troops just might be using
rotary-powered vehicles! </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

FOR INTERNET:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since writing this, I
have found that a number of books and papers were published in China about the
engine in the '70s-early '80s. Most were of course in Chinese; a few were in
English. After that, except for this 1988 SAE paper, nothing surfaces. A Chinese
paper published in 1987 does discuss multifuel rotary engines, giving an idea of
development trends. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

In 2000 SAE published a comprehensive guide to engine manufacturers in China.
None were listed as making rotaries. I have since contacted the editor asking
about the status of rotary engine manufacturing there. He knew of none being
made but intended to have his colleague in China look into it. For now, it
appears that rotary research there has either largely ended or been driven
underground. I doubt it has ended. And if it has indeed gone underground, that
has obvious implications. </span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &#65325;&#65331; &#65328;&#12468;&#12471;&#12483;&#12463;"><o:p>

The fly in the ointment is that though China has impressive research and
manufacturing capabilities, the technological level and execution are less than
ideal (though this is changing). Compare Japanese tractors to Chinese tractors
as an example. Both by various manufacturers have been sold in numbers in the
US. From numerous accounts, the Chinese tractors produce less power and are
heavier, more trouble prone, and less durable and reliable. Much the same issues
plagued Russian equipment. If China is to produce rotary engines in any number,
perhaps it will have to do as VAZ in Russia did (see Rotary History 5): build
copies of Mazda engines. But what has happened since 1988?</font></span><font color="#7D27CD">
