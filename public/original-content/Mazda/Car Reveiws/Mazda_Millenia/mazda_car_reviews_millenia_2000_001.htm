  <p>First it was called the Eunos 800, then it became known as the Mazda Eunos 
  800 and finally the Mazda Millenia.</p>
  <p>When released it was available in one (automatic) version only and was a 
  luxury car with plenty of innovative features. The power source is Mazda 
  Millenia 2.3 litre V6 Miller-cycle engine that, with its Lysholm compressor 
  (supercharger) and shortened compression stroke, produces more torque than a 
  conventional 3.0 litre engine in the same class.</p>
  <p><br>
  Mazda continues to equip its flagship with four-wheel steering, which apart 
  from giving the car a tighter turning circle, is claimed to provide crisp and 
  precise driver control. Traction control is another standard feature. </p>
  <p>Other features of the Millenia include front driver, passenger and side 
  airbags, anti-lock brakes, automatic air conditioning, power-operated glass 
  sunroof, alloy wheels, cruise control, power-operated windows, exterior 
  mirrors and door locks, vehicle speed-sensitive power steering, electrically 
  adjustable front seats and leather upholstery. </p>
  <p>The sound system is a high quality nine-speaker Bose unit with radio, 
  cassette and an in-dash six CD player. Its a neat and compact system thats 
  easy to operate. </p>
  <p>Improvements to the suspension, steering and brakes have improved the 
  driving feel, while extra body strengthening has benefited both handling and 
  noise levels. </p>
  <p>As with the previous models, quality standards are very high in the 
  Millenia. </p>
  <p>However, Mazda still persists in not providing a rubber wear mat under the 
  drivers heel and protective mats will be needed to avoid carpet damage or 
  premature wear. </p>
  <p>Though it lacks the stretch-out space, the Millenia can readily accommodate 
  four adults of average size. The front seats are generally comfortable but 
  they lack shaping for good lateral support when cornering briskly. Rear outer 
  occupants are also comfortably seated, but a centre rear occupant is perched 
  high, with little seat padding and a large floor hump to contend with. </p>
  <p>Considering that the Millenia's engine is only 2.3 litres in capacity and 
  that the car weighs just over 1600 kg, performance is quite good. Sure, there 
  are times when more low-down power would be welcome, however on an overall 
  basis, the performance is lively enough and the engine remains delightfully 
  smooth throughout its operating range. </p>
  <p>The value of four-wheel steering may be debatable when it comes to ultimate 
  handling capabilities, but it certainly does provide a tighter turning circle 
  than would normally be possible in a car of this size. The Millenia owners 
  handbook carries a caution to be careful when entering or exiting a parking 
  space, as 4WS causes the rear of the car to move sideways slightly.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>So in summary the Mazda Millenia was a more appealing proposition than the 
  outgoing Eunos 800. </p>
  <p>All round, the Millenia rates as a very good luxury vehicle thats certainly 
  worthy of consideration; the difficulty for Mazda is that there are plenty of 
  opposition makes in this segment wearing badges with a higher prestige value.
  </p>
  <p>One last thing I would like to add is make sure you check that the vehicle 
  always takes premium unleaded fuel.</div>
