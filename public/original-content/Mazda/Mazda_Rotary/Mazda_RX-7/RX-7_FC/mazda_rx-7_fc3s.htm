June 1981&nbsp; work started on the&nbsp; 'P747', there were 3 broad design
Alternatives, the first was the Evolutionary Realistic Sports car, looking
similar to the RX-7 SA. This design to be dropped as it was thought that it
would out dated very quickly. Then there was the Technically Advanced Sports
Car, this concept was also dropped as it would of been far to expensive and the
market just wasn't ready for a sports car that was this advanced.&nbsp; The 3rd
and final design alterative that they considered was the Civilized Sports Car,
this was the design that made it to production and we now know as the RX-7 FC.
&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">Mazda
wanted to continue with the &nbsp;theme of The desirable yet, affordable Sports
Car. In the hope their customers how brought the RX-7 SA would trade up to the
New RX-7. For some this may have been to big a jump, the P747 was sold for AUD$39,470 when it was first sold on the Australian market. Compared with
AUD$14,875
for the RX-7 SA when it was listed in 1979.&nbsp;</font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">Mazda
tried to reduce the expense of the new RX-7, by doing a little bit delving into the parts bin.
This technique is used by many car companies such as Mazda , Ford, VW and just
about any other company you can think of, to reduces the cost of their
cars.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">Some
of the feature that where on the designers must have list &nbsp;were, a steeply
raked windscreen to increase the sleek look, As small a gap as possible between
the front wheels and the front guard this was to increase the BIG wheel look, a
short rear over hang, a CD factor&nbsp; of 0.30 this was not achieved, but they
did come close with a figure of 0.31, a one piece glass windscreen for the rear,
hidden rails and flush door handles. The designers where also able to achieve
the magical 50/50 weight distetution, this was a step up from the RX-7 SA which
was only 54/46.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">So
now that the designers knew what they wanted, it was time to decide on what to
call it amazing new car. Some of the names that where tossed around RX-6, RX-8
and RX-11 just to name a few,&nbsp; but it was judged that these names did not
suite the P747 and some even said that names like the RX-6 just sounded funny.
Because there had been a linear progression from the RX-2 up to the RX-7 SA it
was decided that the P747 would be called the RX-7 FC, a name the many around
the world have come to know and love. A full explanation of&nbsp; they decided
on the RX-7 can be found in the book entitled RX-7, written by Jack Yamayuchi.
This is an excellent book and I would recommend anyone with an interest in
Rotaries, should read it.</font></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">When
the Gas Guzzler Tax was announced in America in 1983 Mazda called a one month
moratorium on the RX-7, in the end they decided to&nbsp; continue with the Rx-7,
this turned out to be a very wise decision, because the RX-7 FC was perhaps
the&nbsp; most successful rotary to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">The
Series 4 as it was known in Australia,&nbsp; was designed to take the rotary engine from
the mid 1980's to the early nineties (which it did very well). This model had
more alloy parts in it then any other Mazda since the original R360 coupe which
tipped the scales at 380Kgs. But even with all this alloy it was larger and heavier then its
predecessors the Series 1, 2 and 3 (SA), 'P747' tipped the scales at 1190kgs,
which is 50kgs more then RX-7 SA. The list of Alloy parts included the Bonnet,
Suspension arms, Engine Mounts, Brake Calipers, and Jack, the jack alone save
1.3 Kgs over the steel version. But this did not reduce its performance of this
car. This
is mainly due to an increase in engine size from 12A to 13B or 13B turbo.&nbsp;
Performance times where 17.0sec for the RX-7 13B non Turbo and&nbsp; 15.4sec for
the turbo version.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">I
think the real thrill of driving this car comes from the handling of the car.
this is thanks to the very clever suspension system called, Dynamic Tracking Suspension
System (DTSS). This incorporates a Triad-pivot floating hub that controls the
wheels attitudes under specific load conditions and a multi link/pivot
arrangements that and provide anti drive and anti squat effects. so in&nbsp;
other words the system help the driver control the car around the corner better
by controlling the toe-in and toe-out.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">Mazda
was the pioneer of the AAS, Automatic Adjustable Shock absorber System, which it
introduced in the first front wheel drive Mazda 626. This system was also fitted
to the RX-7 FC, although the system was more refined in the RX-7 FC. This system
works by, when the button in the cabin is set on 'Sports' the shocks are in firm
mode causing the car to be more stable for straight line high speeds, while also
keeping squat and roll in check when cornering.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"><font color="#7D27CD">The
RX-7 turbo II was released in 1989 it had a few minor refinements. The biggest
one was the new improved intercooler combine this with a state of the art turbo
which gave a boost in power and also brought the quarter mile time down to
15.0sec and speed 0-100 kms in 6.8sec. This translated into an almost complete
lack of turbo lag which was prevalent in the Toyota Supra and the like. The RX-7
was truly a super car of its day.</font></span></p>
