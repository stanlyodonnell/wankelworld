<h1 align="center"><!--mstheme--><b>Steam Powered Wankel<!--mstheme--></b></h1>
<p>A rotary Wankel type steam engine is an ideal power producer for automotive 
applications. The Wankel is a displacement engine that the steam passes through 
with no reversal in direction (uniflow) and the exhaust is from max displacement 
to min. displacement. </p>
<p>This engine is similar to the Wankel I.C engine. With only one rotor we get 
two overlapping power cycles per crank rotation. A power cycle starts every 180Åã 
of crank rotation and lasts 270Åã. That's 90Åã of overlap, 1/3 of the power cycle. 
Exhaust takes another 270Åã of rotation. A complete cycle is 540Åã of crank 
rotation. The engine is a three-lobe rotor design. As the rotor rotates on the 
eccentric crank each lobe defines a variable volume chamber. In the following 
diagrams we follow the engine through its cycles, Also note that crank rotates 3 
times the rate of the rotor. I.e. For every 90Åã of crank rotation the rotor 
rotates 30Åã. <img src="steam_wankel_001.gif" align="left" width="340" height="343"> </p>
<p>In the illustration to the left color is used to illustrate the engine 
cycles. Bright red is the live throttled steam from the boiler. The darker red 
is the steam expanding after the inlet valve closes. Steam engines use cutoff, 
the practice of admitting steam for part of the stroke and expanding over the 
remaining portion, to control the torque of the engine. A long cutoff is used, 
and necessary, for starting from a stop or hard pulling. Cutting back on the 
cutoff gives better economy. Green is used to indicate the exhaust steam leaving 
the engine. Comparing a single rotor engine with single cylinder double acting 
piston engine we see the same number of power strokes in a revolution. But in 
the rotary engine the power cycles overlap 90Åã. No dead spots! </p>
<p>In a Wankel type engine the effective clearance or compression is function of 
the K factor, rotor radius (distance from an apex to the rotor center)/eccentric 
(crank throw), and rotor dome. The K factor determines the maximum compression 
and rotor lobe must be domed to achieve the minim-desired clearance.
<img src="steam_wankel_002.gif" align="right" width="340" height="337"> </p>
<p>A compounded engine is then constructed of a high pressure and low-pressure 
rotor. The high-pressure exhaust port directly coupled to the low-pressure 
intake port during the high-pressure exhaust cycle. The engine is configured 
such that the low-pressure lobe's power cycle is coincident with high-pressure 
lobe's exhaust. </p>
<p>In the illustration of the compound Wankel to the right, color is also used 
illustrate the steam state. A very light blue used for the inlet steam becoming 
darker and darker as it expands through both rotors until it is finely 
exhausted. This engine designed with a 3 to 1 volume ratio between low pressure 
rotor and high pressure rotor achieves a steam expansion of 8.8 with long 
starting cutoff of 180Åã and goes to 15.0 under normal cutoff of about 90Åã </p>
