<font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WORK utilities have come a long 
way in the last ten years. Mazda kicked off, in their &quot;B&quot; series of utilities 
with no frills work horses that were intended to do a job in reasonable comfort 
and style. Yet, today, those same vehicles have now progressed to what can only 
be regarded as a quite up market off roader in the form of the top of the range 
SDX Bravo dual cab utility.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart of the Bravo series 
utility is the very smooth, quiet, twelve valve four cylinder two point six 
litre unleaded petrol engine (which powered my test vehicle) or, as an 
alternative, the two point five litre diesel power plant.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found the unleaded petrol engine was so smooth that 
it could barely be heard running and yet that docile power plant fairly thrived 
on revs. Sure, it would snooze along in top gear at two thousand RPM but to make 
it really sing and pull strongly it was just a matter of getting a few more revs 
per minute into the equation. Once the tachometer reached the three thousand 
mark the engine was really working happily and starting to feel as though it 
would just keep right on going. Which it could, of course, as the red line was 
in the vicinity of the five thousand RPM mark.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The gear ratios in the five speed box were quite well 
matched to the engine and in low range four wheel drive the free revving engine 
kept the car going in loose stuff without much fuss or bother. A feature of the 
SDX specification is the automatic free wheeling hubs that are activated via a 
dash mounted switch, a useful feature if one mistakenly moves into soft going 
and four wheel drive is suddenly required to extract the car. A press of the 
button, a snappy gear selection from &quot;2H to 4H&quot; and that's all it takes to get 
all four wheels pulling their weight thanks to the combination of four wheel 
drive and the standard limited slip diff. </font>
</p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found that a fair bag full of goodies are part and 
parcel of the Bravo's SDX specs. Starting from the front there is a special 
chrome treatment for the grille. Electrically operated mirrors and windows are 
part of the package, as is central locking. Velour trims on seat and doors, 
integrated door pockets, factory air conditioning, a chromed bull bar and last 
but not least the colour coded rear canopy completes the picture.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my mind this vehicle is made for packing up and 
heading bush or up the beach. With four passengers plus driver seated within the 
cab there is a very large luggage space in the rear thanks to the huge lockable 
canopy area. I found the rear area large enough to sleep comfortably in, as a 
matter of fact. Scott and I spent a weekend camped out bush and all we did was 
to throw an old mattress in the rear section, plus some cooking gear and a bag 
of clothes and there we were, snug as two bugs in a rug.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good sized fully screened windows are part of the 
package and we just slid them open to allow good ventilation and to keep the 
hungry buzzing biting hordes out where they belonged. To all intents and purpose 
the rear canopy is quite weather proof and it sure as hell is mosquito proof as 
well. That's for sure.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the city or on the open highway the Mazda hums 
along quite well at the speed limit. Although the gear box ratios are sensibly 
spaced to make the engine work without over working it I felt that fifth gear 
tends to be fairly tall and if some fast overtaking needed to be done the smart 
move was to shift back to fourth and things will start to happen pretty quickly 
as the engine picks up revolutions.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In all the ute rides quite well although I somehow 
felt that the suspension package on this Bravo SDX tends to be just a tad too 
firm when the vehicle is unloaded. It's not rough, mind, more like a touch too 
willing to return to the position it was in before the bump, pot hole, or 
corrugation that was struck came along. Most likely I see this as a legacy of 
the Bravo series of utilities being primarily designed as work horses, for which 
Mazda makes no apologies. These vehicles are made to carry a solid payload and 
that's that.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On bad corrugations, however, the Bravo shows a 
tendency to bump steer somewhat although all it takes to correct the situation 
is to ease up a little on the loud pedal and the vehicle becomes as docile as a 
pussy cat again. In the paddocks, or sneaking down badly washed out tracks the 
Bravo remained easy to handle and the combination of a good driving position 
plus positive power steering all ensured that I had it pretty easy.</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see this vehicle as being pretty well the ideal 
size for a family man that requires a City vehicle for the week and a good 
recreation vehicle for weekends away.</font></p>
