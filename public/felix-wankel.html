                            <h2>The Man Behind the Engine</h2>
                            <p>Felix Heinrich Wankel was born on August 13, 1902, in Lahr, Germany. A brilliant but unconventional engineer, Wankel never attended university—his expertise came from natural genius and relentless curiosity.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Early Life</h3>
                            <p>Wankel's childhood was marked by illness and isolation, which he spent developing his mechanical creativity. By age 17, he had conceived his first rotary valve design. During World War II, he worked on engine designs for the German military.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Dream</h3>
                            <p>Wankel's obsession was creating an engine without reciprocating parts. He believed the piston engine's up-and-down motion was inefficient and sought a design with purely rotational movement. His famous quote: "I began to see that if you want to build a new type of engine, you must first build a new type of man."</p>

                            <h2>The Rotary Engine</h2>
                            <p>In 1954, Wankel established the Felix Wankel Institute and began serious development of his rotary engine concept. The first working prototype, the DKM 54, ran on February 1, 1957.</p>
                            
                            <h3>How the Dream Became Reality</h3>
                            <p>The breakthrough was the epitrochoid housing shape combined with a triangular rotor. This design allowed the four strokes of internal combustion to occur in a continuously rotating motion. The result was an engine with only three moving parts that could produce power equivalent to a piston engine twice its size.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Technical Achievement</h3>
                            <p>Wankel's engine solved problems that had stumped engineers for decades. The key was the combination of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The epitrochoid combustion chamber shape</li>
                                <li>The triangular rotor with apex seals</li>
                                <li>The eccentric shaft power takeoff</li>
                                <li>Peripheral intake and exhaust ports</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>The Mazda Connection</h2>
                            <p>In 1961, Wankel signed a licensing agreement with NSU Motorenwerke (later Audi). This agreement allowed other companies to develop the rotary engine—including Mazda.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Why Mazda?</h3>
                            <p>While other manufacturers experimented with the rotary and abandoned it due to seal wear and emissions challenges, Mazda saw potential. Under the leadership of Kenichi Yamamoto and the "47 Samurai" engineers, Mazda committed to solving the rotary's problems.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Making It Work</h3>
                            <p>Mazda's engineers spent years perfecting the apex seals, developing new materials and designs that could withstand the harsh environment inside the combustion chamber. Their persistence transformed the rotary from a promising concept into a reliable production engine.</p>

                            <h2>Legacy</h2>
                            <p>Felix Wankel received numerous honors during his lifetime, including honorary doctorates from several universities. He died on October 9, 1988, at age 86, having lived to see his creation power everything from sports cars to aircraft.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Wankel Stamp</h3>
                            <p>In 1986, Germany issued a postage stamp honoring Wankel and his engine—a rare tribute for an engineer. The stamp depicts the rotary engine's distinctive triangular rotor.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Lasting Impact</h3>
                            <p>Today, Wankel's engine powers everything from drones to marine applications. While Mazda remains the only major automaker to mass-produce rotary cars, the engine's influence extends far beyond automotive. Its compact size, light weight, and smooth operation make it ideal for applications where traditional engines are too large or heavy.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Dream Lives On</h3>
                            <p>Felix Wankel's vision of a better engine continues to inspire engineers worldwide. As Mazda develops new rotary technology for hybrid and range-extender applications, the engine that bears his name may yet have its greatest chapter ahead.</p>
