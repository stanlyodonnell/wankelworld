                            <p>The early years of Mazda's rotary program produced some of the most striking automotive designs of the 1960s and 70s. From the futuristic Cosmo Sport to the racing-dominant RX-3, these cars established the rotary's reputation.</p>

                            <p>Mazda's commitment to the rotary engine throughout the 1970s created a diverse lineup of vehicles. The company experimented with rotary power in everything from compact cars to large sedans, even developing a rotary-powered pickup truck (the REPU) and a rotary bus.</p>

                            <h2>RX-7 Through the Generations</h2>
                            <p>The RX-7 is the definitive rotary sports car. Three generations spanning 24 years, each with its own character and following.</p>
                            
                            <h3>SA/FB (1978-1985)</h3>
                            <p>The original. Light, simple, and pure. The first-generation RX-7 established the formula that would define the model: front-mid engine, perfect weight distribution, and that unmistakable rotary sound.</p>
                            
                            <h3>FC (1986-1991)</h3>
                            <p>The second generation brought modern styling and turbocharging. The FC competed directly with Porsche's 944 and established the RX-7 as a world-class sports car. The convertible variant added open-air rotary enjoyment.</p>
                            
                            <h3>FD (1992-2002)</h3>
                            <p>Widely considered one of the finest Japanese sports cars ever made. The FD's timeless styling, sequential twin-turbo performance, and incredible handling make it a certified classic. Values continue to climb as enthusiasts recognize its significance.</p>

                            <p>The rotary engine's motorsport legacy is unmatched. From dominating Japanese touring car racing to winning the world's greatest endurance race, the rotary has proven itself on track.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Japanese Grand Prix Dominance</h3>
                            <p>The Mazda RX-3 won the Japanese Grand Prix for an incredible seven consecutive years (1972-1978). This dominance established Mazda's reputation for building tough, competitive racing engines.</p>
                            
                            <h3>IMSA Racing</h3>
                            <p>In North America, RX-7s were prolific in IMSA racing. The RX-7 holds the record for the most wins by any model in IMSA history. Teams loved the engine's reliability and the car's balanced handling.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Le Mans Victory</h3>
                            <p>The pinnacle of rotary racing achievement. In 1991, the Mazda 787B with its screaming R26B four-rotor engine won the 24 Hours of Le Mans outright—the first Japanese manufacturer and only rotary-powered car to achieve this feat.</p>

                            <p>The 787B's sound is legendary. At full throttle, the R26B four-rotor engine produces a shriek unlike anything else in motorsport. It's been described as "an angry swarm of bees" or "a Formula 1 car from an alternate universe." The sound is so distinctive that fans can identify a 787B approaching from miles away.</p>

                            <p>There's something beautiful about a well-maintained rotary engine bay. The compact engine leaves room for clean layouts, and the distinctive shape of the rotor housings makes every rotary engine instantly recognizable.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Art of the Rotary</h3>
                            <p>From the early 10A with its simple carburetor to the sequential twin-turbo 13B-REW with its complex vacuum system, each generation of rotary has its own character. Clean engine bays showcase the mechanical beauty of Felix Wankel's design.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Modified Rotaries</h3>
                            <p>The aftermarket has embraced the rotary engine. From simple street builds to all-out racing engines, rotary modifications range from mild to wild. Bridge-ported 13Bs, peripheral port monsters, and turbocharged beasts—each has its place in rotary culture.</p>
