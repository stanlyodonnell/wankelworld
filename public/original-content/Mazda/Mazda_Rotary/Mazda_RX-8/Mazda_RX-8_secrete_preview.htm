      Mazda RX8 Secrete Preview Well after about the LONGEST! week and a half, 
      the day finally arrived. On January 25th 2003 at 12:35pm I got my first 
      look at the full production version of all new and much talked about Mazda 
      RX-8. This was at the Yokohama (about 30 minutes from Tokyo) Mazda R&amp;D 
      center, I was an invited guest at the &quot;Mazda RX-8 Secret Preview&quot; </font>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The event started of with a 20 minute slide 
      show/video. The slide show began with a history of the sport in general 
      then moved on to the history of Mazda and finally onto the history of the 
      Rotary engine, mainly the Mazda Rotary. Next came the video this video was 
      not new to me as I had seen it at the Tokyo Auto Saloon 15 days earlier (<a title="see the RX-8 video" href="../../Fun_stuff/Video/Mazda_RX-8_videos/Mazda_RX-8_videos.htm">you 
      can also see it here</a>), but even so I still watched it with great 
      interest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After the video had finished and we had been 
      told the rules and regulation for the day (there was to be absolutely no 
      photography of any kind (I was so disappointed), but you could ask as many 
      question as you wish, you could sit in, touch and admire the cars, 
      accessories and shop options as much as you liked, with in the 80 minute 
      time limit) we where led into the next display hall where the RX-8s were 
      waiting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As we walked into the hall all the Mazda 
      staff that were waiting inside started clapping for us (I don't know why 
      must be a Japanese thing, but it was kind of nice) and then showed us to 
      our sits. The room was set out (<a title="see the room" href="./">click 
      here</a> for lay out) similar to a cafe with each person (or small group) 
      being seated at a small round table with 4 chairs a round it. On each 
      table there was sales guide folder (this is a smaller version of what the 
      sales staff use to help answer any Q's you have) and a &quot;Shop Option&quot; 
      brochure together with a price guide that had been flattened out and 
      laminated separately. In the back left hand corner of the room was a drink 
      area this is where the cute Mazda girls would get either tea, coffee or 
      juice for you. And in the back right hand corner of the room was a long 
      table pilled high with gifts (<a title="See the present" href="./">click 
      here</a> to see what I and everyone else received). On the front left hand 
      side wall of the room was a table with all the &quot;Shop Options&quot; and on the 
      front right hand side w there were 2 display boards the one closest to the 
      front of the room showed all 8&nbsp; paint colours that will be available, 
      the next board showed the seat fabric/colour options that will be 
      available. And the center focus of the room was of coarse the RX-8s. There 
      were 3 THREE!! RX-8s on the left was the RX-8 Type S (Sports) in the 
      middle was the RX-8 Type A (luxury) and finally on the right was the RX-8 
      Type E (base model).</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
