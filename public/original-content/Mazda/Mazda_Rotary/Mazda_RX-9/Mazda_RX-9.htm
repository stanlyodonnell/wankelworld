<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">Wait before you start sending me
emails saying &quot;are you sure there was an RX-9&quot;, let me tell you the
story of how I came across little known Mazda Rotary. One day a few years back I
was looking though a second hand book shop and I found this book with a
yellowy-green cover, on the cover was written the words &quot;Mazda RX-9&quot;
and being a rotorhead this immediately got my attention. I was excited and
confused &quot;what the hell!, there's no such thing as an RX-9&quot;. So I
brought the book and took it home, I must have looked though it a hundred times,
but as there where no pictures of the car, only wiring diagrams I could not work
out what it was, as I am a busy person I put it on the book shelf and forgot
all about it. Until one day a couple years ago, when I was having a clean out I
found it again and said &quot;that's it I have to find out what car this
is!&quot;. After about a month or so of searching and asking around I finally
got some answers which came from David Morris of DMRH (this guy is a wizz when
it comes to Rotary knowledge)&nbsp; he gave me one picture (show above) and the
following information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">The origins of the RX-9 can be
traced back to the 70's, when the RX-4 was known as the Luce in Japanese market.&nbsp;
When production of the RX-4 ceased in 1978 it's successor was also called the
Luce (in the Japanese markets) only this time it was an ugly 4 door hardtop. The
78-79 models had ugly twin upright headlights but the 80-81 version looked
almost exactly like a Mercedes of the day, hence it's nickname on the export
market as the Mercedes version 929.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">Mazda exported the car as a 929
with a piston engine. They fully intended at the time to export the same car as
a rotary option as well. The rotary version was to be called the RX-9 as you
would have been able to choose the piston 929 or the rotary RX-9.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">What stopped them at the eleventh
hour was the fact that the RX-5/Cosmo was a total failure as an export as it was
too Japanese pretending to be American. Huge hit in Japan though.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">So the logic was that the
RX-9/Luce would suffer the same fate. With the RX-7 craze getting towards top
gear, they simply didn't want to chance the car &amp; ruin any possible RX-7
success.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">Worth noting is the fact that
Mazda brought about 6 into Australia for Evaluation as well. They still had the
&quot;Luce&quot; badge but the RX-9 intension would have been there.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#0000FF"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#7D27CD">In the early 90's Mazda tried
again with the RX-8. This was to be sold as a separate export &amp; was actually
the domestic version &quot;Eunos Cosmo&quot; with the famed 20B engine. Its
export name was to be the RX-8. A friend of David Morris actually has a genuine
RX-8 badge from the 90's (how COOL!) as it actually made it that far before
Mazda again pulled the pin at the 11th hour. That was 1991. Keep a look for my
page on this RX-8 (90's RX-8), in the near future.</font><img border="0" src="../../../images/rotary_bullet_small.gif" width="14" height="13"></p>
